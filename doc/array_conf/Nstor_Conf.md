title: Nexenta Storage Configuration Guide
---

### Note: This plugin has been removed.  NexentaStor 5.x uses a new API.


The libStorageMgmt can manage NexentaStor 4.x/3.x via Nstor plugin
(`libstoragemgmt-nstor-plugin` package).

NexentaStor REST service should be enabled. Please contact Nexenta
support for detail.

Once done, the URI will be:

```
nstor://username@host
nstor+ssl://username@host
# The 'username' is the account with 'Can_use_restapi' permission.
# The 'host' is ip/hostname of nextenta management interface.
```
